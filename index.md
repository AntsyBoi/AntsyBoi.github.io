# About me

I have been developing for about 5 years now. I started learning back on khan academy (big mistake) and then later on random tutorials, guides, and youtube videos I found from around the web.

# Projects

   - [Time&Date](https://antsyboi.github.io/Time-n-Date/) ([source](https://github.com/AntsyBoi/Time-n-Date)) This is my flagship project, this is the project that originally taught me what functions are and how to use them in programming and is now retired.
   - [Spigot-EasyBuilder](https://github.com/AntsyBoi/Spigot-EasyBuilder) This is a simple tool to help people build and quickly create a barebones spigot server setup fast.
   - [Hash-API](https://github.com/Small-APIs/Hash-API) Incredibly lightweight (for a nodejs server) and simple sha-256 hashing API with no extra dependencies that aren't already pre-included with node.
   - [Cookie Clicker Script](https://github.com/AntsyBoi/Cookie-Clicker-Script) A very barebones cookie clicker cheat script that can add cookies at regular intervals and wipe.

and those are the actually interesting ones
